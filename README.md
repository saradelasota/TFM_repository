### Introduction

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is composed by content features, lexical features and external features. There are several subsets on the datasets folder and it is included the transformation of all URL scripts into QR code images.

### Installation
To run the files in this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Qrcode, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Models used
They have been implemented 8 different machine learning classifiers and one deep learinig model:
- Logistic Regression
- Knn
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGboost
- LGBM
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Results
All results are saved in the evaluation metric csv.
